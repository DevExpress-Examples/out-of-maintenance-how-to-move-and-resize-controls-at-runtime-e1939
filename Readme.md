# How to move and resize controls at runtime


<p>We have no component which will allow you to resize and move controls at runtime. The LayoutControl allows you to perform a similar task, but its items are always docked. They cannot be placed at any position and overlap each other. </p><p>This example demonstrates how you can achieve the same behavior as that you have at design time.</p><p>We provide this example as is. We will unlikely extend this example in the future and will not research issues specific to this example if they are not related to our components. Please refer to the following MSDN article for more details on this topic:</p><p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163871.aspx">Tailor Your Application with a Custom Forms Designer in .NET</a> </p>
